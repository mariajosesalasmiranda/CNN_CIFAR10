# Artificial Intelligence Project: Building a Neural Network for Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a project for the course "Artificial Intelligence" at the Romanian-American University. The project's main objective is to build and train a neural network to classify images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of at least 80% on the test dataset.

## Project Structure
- CIFAR10.ipynb: Contains the Jupyter Notebook file with the entire project implementation.
- 23-24_C_MAS_1CSB_AI_MiniProject_V1.0.pdf: Contains the instructions for the project.
- LICENSE: Contains the MIT license.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.12.3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mariajosesalasmiranda/CNN_CIFAR10.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd CNN_CIFAR10
```

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook "CNN_CIFAR10"
Open the notebook file located in the notebooks directory.
Run the cells in the notebook to execute the project.

## Project Implementation
The Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates the following steps:
- Data Loading and Preparation: Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Build the Neural Network: Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras.
- Train the model: Train the neural network on the training dataset.
- Evaluatevthe model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
- Make predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new images.
- Performance Analysis and Interpretation: Visualize the training process and the final results.
