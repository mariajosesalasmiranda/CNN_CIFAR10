# Artificial Intelligence Project: Building a Neural Network for Image Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a project for the course "Artificial Intelligence" at the Romanian-American University. The project's main objective is to build and train a neural network to classify images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of at least 80% on the test dataset.

## Getting Started
## Contents
- CIFAR10.ipynb: Contains the Jupyter Notebook file with the entire project implementation.
- 23-24_C_MAS_1CSB_AI_MiniProject_V1.0.pdf: Contains the instructions for the project.
- LICENSE: Contains the MIT license.
